 The collision operator is often approximated by a BGK collision operator:
 where   f i  0   {\displaystyle f_{i}^{0}} is the local equilibrium distribution.
 The moments of the   f i   {\displaystyle f_{i}} give the local conserved quantities. The density is given by
 and the local momentum is given by
 For the popular isothermal lattice Boltzmann methods these are the only conserved quantities. Thermal models also conserve energy and therefore have an additional conserved quantity:
 The collision operator has to respect the conservation laws. Therefore the equilibirum distribution   f i  0   {\displaystyle f_{i}^{0}} must have the same conserved moments as the   f i   {\displaystyle f_{i}} .
