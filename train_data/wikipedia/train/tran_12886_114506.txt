 Symmetrical components are most commonly used for analysis of three-phase electrical power systems. If the phase quantities are expressed in phasor notation using complex numbers, a vector can be formed for the three phase quantities. For example, a vector for three phase voltages could be written as
 where the subscripts 0, 1, and 2 refer respectively to the zero, positive, and negative sequence components. The sequence components differ only by their phase angles, which are symmetrical and so are    2 3  π  {\displaystyle \scriptstyle {\frac {2}{3}}\pi } radians or 120°. Define the operator   α  {\displaystyle \scriptstyle \alpha } phasor vector forward by that angle.
 Note that α3 = 1 so that α−1 = α2.
