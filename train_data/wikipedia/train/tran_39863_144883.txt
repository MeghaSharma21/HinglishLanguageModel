 sandharitron kaa vargeekaran praaia: unke nirmaan main prayukt dielectric padaarth ke aadhaar par kiya jaataa he. dielectric bhi do prakaar ke hote hai - balk kuchaalak evam dhaatu-oxide ke film . isi prakaar, sandharitra niyat maan vaale ho sakate hai yaa parivarti maan vaale .
 
 Capacitors may be marked with 3 or more coloured bands or dots. 3-colour coding encodes most significant digit, second most significant digit, and multiplier. Additional bands have meanings which may vary from one type to another. Low-tolerance capacitors may begin with the first 3 digits of the value. It is usually, but not always, possible to work out what scheme is used by the particular colours used. Cylindrical capacitors marked with bands may look like resistors.
