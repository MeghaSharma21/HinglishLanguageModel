 The Wenner four-pin method, as shown in figure above, is the most commonly used technique for soil resistivity measurements.Using the Wenner method, the apparent soil resistivity value is:
 where
 ρE = measured apparent soil resistivity 
 a = electrode spacing 
 b = depth of the electrodes 
 RW = Wenner resistance measured as "V/I" in Figure If b is small compared to a, as is the case of probes penetrating the ground only for a short distance, the previous equation can be reduced to:
 
 In the Schlumberger method the distance between the voltages probe is a and the distances from voltages probe and currents probe are c .
 Using the Schlumberger method, if b is small compared to a and c, and c>2a, the apparent soil resistivity value is:
 where
 ρE = measured apparent soil resistivity 
 a = electrode spacing 
 b = depth of the electrodes 
 c = electrode spacing 
 RS = Schlumberger resistance measured as "V/I" in Figure
