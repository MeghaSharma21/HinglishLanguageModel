 jin vibhinn avyavon kaa upyog karke electronic paripath banaaye jate hai unhen electronic avyav kehete hai electronic avyav do sire vaale, teen siron vaale yaa isse adhik siron vaale hote hai jinhen shoulder karke yaa kisi anya vidhi se paripath main joda jaataa he. pratirohak, prerakatv, sandharitra, diod, transistor, mossphate, aijibiti, esasiaar, prakaash utsarjak diod, aaparational emplifire evam anya ekikrut paripath aadi pramukh electronic avyav hai. 
 electronic avyav do prakaar ke hote hai-
 Devices to make electrical connection
 Cables with connectors or terminals at their ends
 Components that may be made to either conduct or not 
 Components used to resist current.
 Passive components that protect circuits from excessive currents or voltages
 Components that store electrical charge in an electrical field.Capacitors are used for filtration in the electronic circuits.Capacitors in general pass changing and block unchanging voltage levels.
 Electrical components that use magnetism
 Components that use more than one type of passive component
