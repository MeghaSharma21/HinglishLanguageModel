 Switching times range from tens of nanoseconds to a few hundred microseconds, depending on the device. MOSFET drain source resistances increase as more current flows through the device. As frequencies increase the losses increase as well, making BJTs more attractive. Power MOSFETs can be paralleled in order to increase switching current and therefore overall switching power. Nominal voltages for MOSFET switching devices range from a few volts to a little over 1000 V, with currents up to about 100 A or so. Newer devices may have higher operational characteristics. MOSFET devices are not bi-directional, nor are they reverse voltage blocking.
 An example of this new device from ABB shows how this device improves on GTO technology for switching high voltage and high current in power electronics applications. According to ABB, the IGCT devices are capable of switching in excess of 5000 VAC and 5000 A at very high frequencies, something not possible to do efficiently with GTO devices.
