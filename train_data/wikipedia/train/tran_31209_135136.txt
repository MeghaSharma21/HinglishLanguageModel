 neeche di gayin sarvasamikaaye trivimiya yuklidia avkaash ke sadishon se sambandhit hai inamen se kuch adhik vima vaale sadishon ke liye bhi satya hai. udhaaharan ke liye, do sadishon kaa sadish gunanfal sabhi vimaaon ke liye uplabdh nahin he. 
 sadish A kaa pariman, is sadish ke teen paraspar lambavat dishaao main component ke virgon ke yoga ke vargamul ke baraabar hota he. 
 yah pariman adish gunanfal kaa prayog karte hue nimnlikhit prakaar se bhi abhivyakt kiya ja saktaa he-
 Here the notation denotes the dot product of vectors A and B.
 The vector product and the scalar product of two vectors define the angle between them, say θ:
 To satisfy the right-hand rule, for positive θ, vector B is counter-clockwise from A, and for negative θ it is clockwise.
 Here the notation A × B denotes the vector cross product of vectors A and B.The Pythagorean trigonometric identity then provides:
 If a vector A = makes angles α, β, γ with an orthogonal set of x-, y- and z-axes, then:
 and analogously for angles β, γ. Consequently:
 with     i ^ ,    j ^ ,    k ^   {\displaystyle {\hat {\mathbf {i} }},\ {\hat {\mathbf {j} }},\ {\hat {\mathbf {k} }}} unit vectors along the axis directions.
 The area Σ of a parallelogram with sides A and B containing the angle θ is:
 which will be recognized as the magnitude of the vector cross product of the vectors A and B lying along the sides of the parallelogram. That is:
 The square of this expression is:
 where Γ is the Gram determinant of A and B defined by:
 In a similar fashion, the squared volume V of a parallelepiped spanned by the three vectors A, B and C is given by the Gram determinant of the three vectors:
 This process can be extended to n-dimensions.
 Some of the following algebraic relations refer to the dot product and the cross product of vectors. These relations can be found in a variety of sources, for example, see Albright.
