 Let f = cx2 defined on R, where c > 0 is a fixed constant.
 For x* fixed, the function x*x – f = x*x – cx2 of saanchaa:Mvar has the first derivative x* – 2cx and second derivative −2c; there is one stationary point at x = x*/2c, which is always a maximum. Thus, I* = R and 
 Clearly, 
 namely f ** = f.
 Let f = x2 for x ∈ I = .
 For x* fixed, x*x − f is continuous on saanchaa:Mvar compact, hence it always takes a finite maximum on it; it follows that I* = R. The stationary point at x = x*/2 is in the domain if and only if 4 ≤ x* ≤ 6, otherwise the maximum is taken either at x = 2, or x = 3. It follows that
 The function f = cx is convex, for every saanchaa:Mvar . Clearly x*x − f = x is never bounded from above as a function of saanchaa:Mvar, unless x* − c = 0. Hence f* is defined on I* = {c} and f* = 0.
 One may check involutivity: of course x*x − f* is always bounded as a function of x* ∈ {c}, hence I ** = R. Then, for all saanchaa:Mvar one has 
 and hence f ** = cx = f.
 Let 
 be defined on X = Rn, where saanchaa:Mvar is a real, positive definite matrix. Then saanchaa:Mvar is convex, and
 has gradient p − 2Ax and Hessian −2A, which is negative; hence the stationary point x = A−1p/2 is a maximum. We have X* = Rn, and
