 where:
 In the case where only one level of ionization is important, we have   n 1  = n e   {\displaystyle n_{1}=n_{e}} and defining the total density n as   n = n 0  + n 1   {\displaystyle n=n_{0}+n_{1}}, the Saha equation simplifies to:
 where   Ïµ  {\displaystyle \epsilon } is the energy of ionization.
 The Saha equation is useful for determining the ratio of particle densities for two different ionization levels. The most useful form of the Saha equation for this purpose is
 where Z denotes the partition function. The Saha equation can be seen as a restatement of the equilibrium condition for the chemical potentials:
