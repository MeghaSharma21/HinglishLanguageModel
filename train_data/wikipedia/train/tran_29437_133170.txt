 This is the only remaining Carnegie building in the Municipality of Chatham-Kent still operating as a library. It was built in 1913 with a donation of $8,000 received from Andrew Carnegie in 1906. In the 1980â€™s the building was designated an historic site under the Ontario Heritage Act. It remained unchanged for many years until after the amalgamation of the County of Kent and City of Chatham. In 2000, the townspeople of Dresden celebrated the grand opening of the refurbished library. 
 Closed in 2010, now in private hands
