 For a given transistor, Vbe does not vary significantly during use. As Vcc is of fixed value, on selection of Rb, the base current Ib is fixed. Therefore, this type is called fixed bias type of circuit.
 Also for given circuit,

 Due to the above inherent drawbacks, fixed bias is rarely used in linear circuits . Instead, it is often used in circuits where transistor is used as a switch. However, one application of fixed bias is to achieve crude automatic gain control in the transistor by feeding the base resistor from a DC signal derived from the AC output of a later stage.
 This configuration employs negative feedback to prevent thermal runaway and stabilize the operating point. In this form of biasing, the base resistor   R b   {\displaystyle R_{\text{b}}} is connected to the collector instead of connecting it to the DC source   V cc   {\displaystyle V_{\text{cc}}} . So any thermal runaway will induce a voltage drop across the   R C   {\displaystyle R_{\text{C}}} resistor that will throttle the transistor's base current.
 From Kirchhoff's voltage law, the voltage   V  R  b    {\displaystyle V_{{\text{R}}_{\text{b}}}} across the base resistor   R b   {\displaystyle R_{\text{b}}} is
 By the Ebers–Moll model,   I c  = β I b   {\displaystyle I_{\text{c}}=\beta I_{\text{b}}}, and so
 From Ohm's law, the base current   I b  = V  R  b   /  R b   {\displaystyle I_{\text{b}}=V_{{\text{R}}_{\text{b}}}/R_{\text{b}}}, and so
 Hence, the base current   I b   {\displaystyle I_{\text{b}}} is
 If   V be   {\displaystyle V_{\text{be}}} is held constant and temperature increases, then the collector current   I c   {\displaystyle I_{\text{c}}} increases. However, a larger   I c   {\displaystyle I_{\text{c}}} causes the voltage drop across resistor   R c   {\displaystyle R_{\text{c}}} to increase, which in turn reduces the voltage   V  R  b    {\displaystyle V_{{\text{R}}_{\text{b}}}} across the base resistor   R b   {\displaystyle R_{\text{b}}} . A lower base-resistor voltage drop reduces the base current   I b   {\displaystyle I_{\text{b}}}, which results in less collector current   I c   {\displaystyle I_{\text{c}}} . Because an increase in collector current with temperature is opposed, the operating point is kept stable.

 upyog:The negative feedback also increases the input impedance of the amplifier as seen from the base, which can be advantageous.Due to the gain reduction from feedback, this biasing form is used only when the trade-off for stability is warranted.
 The fixed bias circuit is modified by attaching an external resistor to the emitter. This resistor introduces negative feedback that stabilizes the Q-point. From Kirchhoff's voltage law, the voltage across the base resistor is
 From Ohm's law, the base current is
 The way feedback controls the bias point is as follows. If Vbe is held constant and temperature increases, emitter current increases. However, a larger Ie increases the emitter voltage Ve = IeRe, which in turn reduces the voltage VRb across the base resistor. A lower base-resistor voltage drop reduces the base current, which results in less collector current because Ic = β Ib. Collector current and emitter current are related by Ic = α Ie with α ≈ 1, so the increase in emitter current with temperature is opposed, and the operating point is kept stable.
 Similarly, if the transistor is replaced by another, there may be a change in Ic . By similar process as above, the change is negated and operating point kept stable.

 The feedback also increases the input impedance of the amplifier when seen from the base, which can be advantageous. Due to the above disadvantages, this type of biasing circuit is used only with careful consideration of the trade-offs involved.
 Collector-Stabilized Biasing
 The voltage divider is formed using external resistors R1 and R2. The voltage across R2 forward biases the emitter junction. By proper selection of resistors R1 and R2, the operating point of the transistor can be made independent of β. In this circuit, the voltage divider holds the base voltage fixed independent of base current provided the divider current is large compared to the base current. However, even with a fixed base voltage, collector current varies with temperature so an emitter resistor is added to stabilize the Q-point, similar to the above circuits with emitter resistor. The voltage divider configuration achieves the correct voltages by the use of resistors in certain patterns. By manipulating the resistors in certain ways you can achieve more stable current levels without having β value affect it too much.
 In this circuit the base voltage is given by:
    V B  =   {\displaystyle V_{B}=\ } voltage across   R 2    {\displaystyle R_{2}\ }   = V c c   R 2    − I b    R 1  R 2      {\displaystyle =V_{cc}{\frac {R_{2}}{}}-I_{b}{\frac {R_{1}R_{2}}{}}} 
 Also   V B  = V b e  + I e  R e    {\displaystyle V_{B}=V_{be}+I_{e}R_{e}\ }

 The standard voltage divider circuit discussed above faces a drawback – AC feedback caused by resistor RE reduces the gain. This can be avoided by placing a capacitor in parallel with Re, as shown in circuit diagram. The result is that the DC operating point is well controlled, while the AC-gain is much higher, rather than the much lower value of   R c  /  R e   {\displaystyle R_{\text{c}}/R_{\text{e}}} without the capacitor. 
 When a split supply is available, this biasing circuit is the most effective, and provides zero bias voltage at the emitter or collector for load. The negative supply Vee is used to forward-bias the emitter junction through Re. The positive supply Vcc is used to reverse-bias the collector junction. Only two resistors are necessary for the common collector stage and four resistors for the common emitter or common base stage.
 We know that,
 Vb − Ve = Vbe
 If Rb is small enough, base voltage will be approximately zero. Therefore, emitter current is,
 Ie = /Re
 The operating point is independent of β if Re >> Rb/β

 Disadvantages:
 This type can only be used when a split power supply is available.
 Class B and AB amplifiers employ 2 active devices to cover the complete 360 deg of input signal flow. Each transistor is therefore biased to perform over approximately 180 deg of the input signal. Class B bias is when the collector current Ic with no signal is just conducting . Class-AB bias is when the collector current Ic is about 1/4 of maximum possible value.The class-AB push–pull output amplifier circuit below could be the basis for a moderate-power audio amplifier. 
 Q3 is a common emitter stage that provides amplification of the signal and the DC bias current through D1 and D2 to generate a bias voltage for the output devices. The output pair are arranged in class-AB push–pull, also called a complementary pair. The diodes D1 and D2 provide a small amount of constant voltage bias for the output pair, just biasing them into the conducting state so that crossover distortion is minimized. That is, the diodes push the output stage into class-AB mode .
 This design automatically stabilizes its operating point, since overall feedback internally operates from DC up through the audio range and beyond. The use of fixed diode bias requires the diodes to be both electrically and thermally matched to the output transistors. If the output transistors conduct too much, they can easily overheat and destroy themselves, as the full current from the power supply is not limited at this stage.
 A common solution to help stabilize the output device operating point is to include some emitter resistors, typically an ohm or so. Calculating the values of the circuit's resistors and capacitors is done based on the components employed and the intended use of the amplifier.
